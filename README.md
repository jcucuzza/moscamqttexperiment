# moscamqttexperiment

Very simple excersise to test the lightweight features of mosca mqtt pub/sub on seperate nodejs severs.

to get started you will need nodejs installed:

`clone this repo`

navigate to its directory on each folder in a seperate terminal or command prompt

`run npm install on all 3 (might need to run npm install nodemon)`

on each terminal or command prompt 

type `nodemon` then hit enter

logs should display messages coming from publisher -> broker -> subscriber.
